#' Read a Sheet into a data frame
#'
#' This is the main "read" function of the googlesheets4 package. The goal is
#' that `read_sheet()` is to a Google Sheet as `readr::read_csv()` is to a csv
#' file or `read_excel()` is to an Excel spreadsheet. It's still under
#' development, but is quite usable now. **Note that googlesheets4 is not wired
#' up for auth yet (happening soon!)**, so at the moment the target Sheet must
#' be readable by anyone with a link (see examples for how to accomplish via
#' googledrive).
#'
#' @section Column specification:
#'
#'   Column types must be specified in a single string of readr-style short
#'   codes, e.g. "cci?l" means "character, character, integer, guess, logical".
#'   This is not where googlesheets4's col spec will end up, but it gets the
#'   ball rolling in a way that is consistent with readr and doesn't reinvent
#'   any wheels.
#'
#'   Shortcodes for column types:

#'   * `_` or `-`: Skip. Data in a skipped column is still requested from the
#'   API (the high-level functions in this package are rectangle-oriented), but
#'   is not parsed into the data frame output.
#'   * `?`: Guess. A type is guessed for each cell and then a consensus type is
#'   selected for each column. If no atomic type is suitable for all cells, a
#'   list-column is created, in which each cell is converted to an R object of
#'   "best" type". If no column types are specified, i.e. `col_types = NULL`,
#'   all types are guessed.
#'   * `l`: Logical.
#'   * `i`: Integer. This type is never guessed from the data, because Sheets
#'   have no formal cell type for integers.
#'   * `d` or `n`: Numeric, in sense of "double".
#'   * `D`: Date. This type is never guessed from the data, because date cells
#'   are just serial datetimes that bear a "date" format.
#'   * `t`: Time of day. This type is never guessed from the data, because time
#'   cells are just serial datetimes that bear a "time" format. *Not implemented
#'   yet; returns POSIXct.*
#'   * `T`: Datetime, specifically POSIXct.
#'   * `c`: Character.
#'   * `C`: Cell. This type is unique to googlesheets4. This returns raw cell
#'   data, as an R list, which consists of everything sent by the Sheets API for
#'   that cell. Has S3 type of `"CELL_SOMETHING"` and `"SHEETS_CELL"`. Mostly
#'   useful internally, but exposed for those who want direct access to, e.g.,
#'   formulas and formats.
#'   * `L`: List, as in "list-column". Each cell is a length-1 atomic vector of
#'   its discovered type.
#'   * *Still to come*: duration (code will be `:`) and factor (code will be
#'   `f`).
#'
#' @param ss Something that identifies a Google Sheet: its file ID, a URL from
#'   which we can recover the ID, or a [`dribble`][googledrive::dribble], which
#'   is how googledrive represents Drive files. Processed through
#'   [as_sheets_id()].
#' @param sheet Sheet to read, as in "worksheet" or "tab". Either a string (the
#'   name of a sheet), or an integer (the position of the sheet). Ignored if the
#'   sheet is specified via `range`. If neither argument specifies the sheet,
#'   defaults to the first visible sheet.
#' @param range A cell range to read from. If `NULL`, all non-empty cells are
#'   read. Otherwise specify `range` as described in [Sheets A1
#'   notation](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts#a1_notation)
#'    or using the helpers documented in [cell-specification]. Sheets uses
#'   fairly standard spreadsheet range notation, although a bit different from
#'   Excel. Examples of valid ranges: `"Sheet1!A1:B2"`, `"Sheet1!A:A"`,
#'   `"Sheet1!1:2"`, `"Sheet1!A5:A"`, `"A1:B2"`, `"Sheet1"`. Interpreted
#'   strictly, even if the range forces the inclusion of leading, trailing, or
#'   embedded empty rows or columns. Takes precedence over `skip`, `n_max` and
#'   `sheet`. Note `range` can be a named range, like `"sales_data"`, without
#'   any cell reference.
#' @param col_names `TRUE` to use the first row as column names, `FALSE` to get
#'   default names, or a character vector to provide column names directly. In
#'   all cases, names are processed through [tibble::tidy_names()]. If user
#'   provides `col_types`, `col_names` can have one entry per column or one
#'   entry per unskipped column.
#' @param col_types Column types. Either `NULL` to guess all from the
#'   spreadsheet or a string of readr-style shortcodes, with one character or
#'   code per column. If exactly one `col_type` is specified, it is recycled.
#'   See Details for more.
#' @param na Character vector of strings to interpret as missing values. By
#'   default, blank cells are treated as missing data.
#' @param trim_ws Logical. Should leading and trailing whitespace be trimmed
#'   from cell contents?
#' @param skip Minimum number of rows to skip before reading anything, be it
#'   column names or data. Leading empty rows are automatically skipped, so this
#'   is a lower bound. Ignored if `range` is given.
#' @param n_max Maximum number of data rows to read. Trailing empty rows are
#'   automatically skipped, so this is an upper bound on the number of rows in
#'   the returned tibble. Ignored if `range` is given.
#' @param guess_max Maximum number of data rows to use for guessing column
#'   types.
