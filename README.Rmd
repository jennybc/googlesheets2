## Overview

googlesheets4 provides an R interface to [Google Sheets](https://spreadsheets.google.com/) via the [Sheets API v4](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/). It is a reboot of an earlier package called [googlesheets](https://cran.r-project.org/package=googlesheets).

*Why **4**? Why googlesheets**4**? Did I miss googlesheets1 through 3? No. The idea is to name the package after the corresponding version of the Sheets API. In hindsight, the original googlesheets should have been googlesheets**3**.*

## Installation

You can install the released version of googlesheets4 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("googlesheets4")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/googlesheets4")
```

## Auth

googlesheets4 will, by default, help you interact with Sheets as an authenticated Google user. If you don't need to access private Sheets, use `sheets_deauth()` to indicate there is no need for a token. See the article [googlesheets4 auth](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/auth.html) for more.

For this overview, we've logged into Google as a specific user in a hidden chunk.

## Attach googlesheets4

```{r}
library(googlesheets4)
```

## Read

The main "read" function of the googlesheets4 package goes by two names, because we want it to make sense in two contexts:

* `read_sheet()` evokes other table-reading functions, like
 `readr::read_csv()` and `readxl::read_excel()`. The `sheet` in this case
  refers to a Google (spread)Sheet.
* `range_read()` is the right name according to the naming convention used
  throughout the googlesheets4 package.
  
`read_sheet()` and `range_read()` are synonyms and you can use either one. Here we'll use `read_sheet()`.

googlesheets4 is pipe-friendly (and reexports `%>%`), but works just fine without the pipe.

Read from

  * a URL
  * a Sheet ID
  * a [`dribble`](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org/reference/dribble.html)
    produced by the googledrive package, which can lookup by file name

These all achieve the same thing:

```{r}
# URL
read_sheet("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY/edit#gid=780868077")

# Sheet ID
read_sheet("1U6Cf_qEOhiR9AZqTqS3mbMF3zt2db48ZP5v3rkrAEJY")

# a googledrive "dribble"
googledrive::drive_get("gapminder") %>% 
  read_sheet()
```

See the article [Find and Identify Sheets](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/find-identify-sheets.html) for more about specifying the Sheet you want to address. See the article [Read Sheets](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/find-identify-sheets.html) for more about reading from specific sheets or ranges, setting column type, and getting low-level cell data.

## Write

`gs4_create()` creates a brand new Google Sheet and can optionally send some initial data.

```{r}
(ss <- gs4_create("fluffy-bunny", sheets = list(flowers = head(iris))))
```

`sheet_write()` (over)writes a whole data frame into a (work)sheet within a (spread)Sheet.

```{r}
head(mtcars) %>% 
  sheet_write(ss, sheet = "autos")
ss
```

`range_write()` and `sheet_append()` are additional writing functions that are useful in specific situations. See the article [Write Sheets](https://googlesheets4.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/write-sheets.html) for more about writing to Sheets.

```{r include = FALSE}
googledrive::drive_trash(ss)
```

## Context

googlesheets4 draws on and complements / emulates other packages in the tidyverse:

  * [googlesheets](https://cran.r-project.org/package=googlesheets) is the package that googlesheets4 replaces. Main improvements in googlesheets4: (1) wraps the current, most modern Sheets API; (2) leaves all "whole file"
  operations to googledrive; and (3) uses shared infrastructure for auth and more, from the gargle package. The v3 API wrapped by googlesheets is deprecated. [Starting in April/May 2020](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/migrate-your-apps-use-latest-sheets-api),
  features will gradually be disabled and it's anticipated the API will fully
  shutdown in September 2020. At that point, the original googlesheets
  package must be retired.
  * [googledrive](https://googledrive.tidyverse.org) provides a fully-featured interface to the Google Drive API. Any "whole file" operations can be accomplished with googledrive: upload or download or update a spreadsheet, copy, rename, move, change permission, delete, etc. googledrive supports Team Drives.
  * [readxl](https://readxl.tidyverse.org) is the tidyverse package for reading Excel files (xls or xlsx) into an R data frame. googlesheets4 takes cues from parts of the readxl interface, especially around specifying which cells to read.
  * [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org) is the tidyverse package for reading delimited files (e.g., csv or tsv) into an R data frame. googlesheets4 takes cues from readr with respect to column type specification.
