\title{Read a Sheet into a data frame}
\usage{
read_sheet(ss, sheet = NULL, range = NULL, col_names = TRUE,
  col_types = NULL, na = "", trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 0,
  n_max = Inf, guess_max = min(1000, n_max))

sheets_read(ss, sheet = NULL, range = NULL, col_names = TRUE,
  col_types = NULL, na = "", trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 0,
  n_max = Inf, guess_max = min(1000, n_max))
}
\arguments{
\item{ss}{Something that identifies a Google Sheet: its file ID, a URL from
which we can recover the ID, or a \code{\link[googledrive:dribble]{dribble}}, which
is how googledrive represents Drive files. Processed through
\code{\link[=as_sheets_id]{as_sheets_id()}}.}

\item{sheet}{Sheet to read, as in "worksheet" or "tab". Either a string (the
name of a sheet), or an integer (the position of the sheet). Ignored if the
sheet is specified via \code{range}. If neither argument specifies the sheet,
defaults to the first visible sheet.}

\item{range}{A cell range to read from. If \code{NULL}, all non-empty cells are
read. Otherwise specify \code{range} as described in \href{https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts#a1_notation}{Sheets A1 notation}
or using the helpers documented in \link{cell-specification}. Sheets uses
fairly standard spreadsheet range notation, although a bit different from
Excel. Examples of valid ranges: \code{"Sheet1!A1:B2"}, \code{"Sheet1!A:A"},
\code{"Sheet1!1:2"}, \code{"Sheet1!A5:A"}, \code{"A1:B2"}, \code{"Sheet1"}. Interpreted
strictly, even if the range forces the inclusion of leading, trailing, or
embedded empty rows or columns. Takes precedence over \code{skip}, \code{n_max} and
\code{sheet}. Note \code{range} can be a named range, like \code{"sales_data"}, without
any cell reference.}

\item{col_names}{\code{TRUE} to use the first row as column names, \code{FALSE} to get
default names, or a character vector to provide column names directly. In
all cases, names are processed through \code{\link[tibble:tidy_names]{tibble::tidy_names()}}. If user
provides \code{col_types}, \code{col_names} can have one entry per column or one
entry per unskipped column.}

\item{col_types}{Column types. Either \code{NULL} to guess all from the
spreadsheet or a string of readr-style shortcodes, with one character or
code per column. If exactly one \code{col_type} is specified, it is recycled.
See Details for more.}

\item{na}{Character vector of strings to interpret as missing values. By
default, blank cells are treated as missing data.}

\item{trim_ws}{Logical. Should leading and trailing whitespace be trimmed
from cell contents?}

\item{skip}{Minimum number of rows to skip before reading anything, be it
column names or data. Leading empty rows are automatically skipped, so this
is a lower bound. Ignored if \code{range} is given.}

\item{n_max}{Maximum number of data rows to read. Trailing empty rows are
automatically skipped, so this is an upper bound on the number of rows in
the returned tibble. Ignored if \code{range} is given.}

\item{guess_max}{Maximum number of data rows to use for guessing column
types.}

\description{
This is the main "read" function of the googlesheets4 package. The goal is
that \code{read_sheet()} is to a Google Sheet as \code{readr::read_csv()} is to a csv
file or \code{read_excel()} is to an Excel spreadsheet. It's still under
development, but is quite usable now. \strong{Note that googlesheets4 is not wired
up for auth yet (happening soon!)}, so at the moment the target Sheet must
be readable by anyone with a link (see examples for how to accomplish via
googledrive).
}
\section{Column specification}{


Column types must be specified in a single string of readr-style short
codes, e.g. "cci?l" means "character, character, integer, guess, logical".
This is not where googlesheets4's col spec will end up, but it gets the
ball rolling in a way that is consistent with readr and doesn't reinvent
any wheels.

Shortcodes for column types:
\itemize{
\item \code{_} or \code{-}: Skip. Data in a skipped column is still requested from the
API (the high-level functions in this package are rectangle-oriented), but
is not parsed into the data frame output.
\item \code{?}: Guess. A type is guessed for each cell and then a consensus type is
selected for each column. If no atomic type is suitable for all cells, a
list-column is created, in which each cell is converted to an R object of
"best" type". If no column types are specified, i.e. \code{col_types = NULL},
all types are guessed.
\item \code{l}: Logical.
\item \code{i}: Integer. This type is never guessed from the data, because Sheets
have no formal cell type for integers.
\item \code{d} or \code{n}: Numeric, in sense of "double".
\item \code{D}: Date. This type is never guessed from the data, because date cells
are just serial datetimes that bear a "date" format.
\item \code{t}: Time of day. This type is never guessed from the data, because time
cells are just serial datetimes that bear a "time" format. \emph{Not implemented
yet; returns POSIXct.}
\item \code{T}: Datetime, specifically POSIXct.
\item \code{c}: Character.
\item \code{C}: Cell. This type is unique to googlesheets4. This returns raw cell
data, as an R list, which consists of everything sent by the Sheets API for
that cell. Has S3 type of \code{"CELL_SOMETHING"} and \code{"SHEETS_CELL"}. Mostly
useful internally, but exposed for those who want direct access to, e.g.,
formulas and formats.
\item \code{L}: List, as in "list-column". Each cell is a length-1 atomic vector of
its discovered type.
\item \emph{Still to come}: duration (code will be \code{:}) and factor (code will be
\code{f}).
